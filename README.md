# Human-Activity-Recognision-with-Smartphones
The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.

This repo contain a jupyter notebook [**'mobile_data.ipynb'**](https://github.com/samyak1234/Human-Activity-Recognision-with-Smartphones/blob/master/mobile_data.ipynb) in which I performed **Data Visualisation**, **Data cleaning**, and **Hyperparameter tuning** for various classifiers which includes -

- Logistic Regression
- Linear SVM
- Kernal SVM
- Dicision Tree
- Random Forest

The best results were given by **Linear SVM** with accuracy = 96.88 % 
The accuracies of other classifiers are as follows-
